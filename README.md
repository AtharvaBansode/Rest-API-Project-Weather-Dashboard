# Rest-API-Project-Weather-Dashboard
This Weather Dashboard is a web application built using Flask that allows users to retrieve real-time weather information for any city they enter. The project leverages various Flask modules such as render_template, request, redirect, and url_for, along with the requests library for API calls to fetch weather data. The application also integrates Flask-SQLAlchemy for database management and utilizes HTML for rendering the frontend.

Key Features:
City-based Weather Information: Enter the name of a city, and the dashboard will provide up-to-date weather details.
Temperature: Displayed in Celsius (e.g. 23.65 Â°C).

Weather Conditions: A brief description of the current weather (e.g., overcast clouds).

Humidity: Displayed as a percentage (e.g. 92%).

Wind Speed: Displayed in meters per second (e.g. 3.89 m/s).

This project is configured using a config.py file to manage API keys and other settings. The weather data is fetched via REST API calls and presented in a clean and user-friendly interface.

The code is well-structured and easily customizable, making it a great starting point for anyone looking to build a weather application or learn more about REST APIs and Flask.
